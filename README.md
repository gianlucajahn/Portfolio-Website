# Portfolio Website
After learning some stuff now I thought why not create a portfolio website? 
I didn't want to solely base it on what I learned so far though, because I planned on using the portfolio website for some time now. I will redo it from scratch
as soon as I feel comfortable that I can build my best portfolio website that doesn't ever need another rework. Since that's going to take a couple months, I tried to get a website going that I would be somewhat pleased with, for the time being.

## üë®‚Äçüî¨ Features
I am quite a perfectionist when it comes to UI / UX design and it seemed like jQuery could solve the features that I wanted to implement more efficiently, so I started 
to learn and use jQuery. Now obviously, I am still learning, but it already helped me a ton, especially in getting myself some researching practice. Current features 
include:

- fadeIn of the <body> on every load of the page.
- fadeOut of the <body> every time an <a> tag is being clicked on.
- fadeIn of the <body> in case the "back" arrow of the client's browser is used.
  This would usually end up in the earlier page still being faded out, due to the fact that this state is being saved.
- Designated function to make sure the above feature works on iOS, which it natively does not.
- Changing <button> text on click event.
- Keyframes for a bobbing animation on "home" sub page.
- 1 of 3 different mp3's played when a click event is fired on specific elements
- Entrance Subpage
- Sources Subpage
- Contact Subpage
- Media Queries providing Responsiveness for all sub pages

 ### üë∑ Work in Progress
 This is still a work in progress. I will update this with a dedicated project's subpage as soon as 
 I feel like my portfolio needs one additionally to my GitHub! Feel free to take a look in here every once in a while or use the "Watch" feature on GitHub.
