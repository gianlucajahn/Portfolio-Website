# Portfolio Website
After learning some stuff now I thought why not create a portfolio website? 
I didn't want to solely base it on what I learned so far though, because I planned on using the portfolio website for some time now. I will redo it from scratch
as soon as I feel comfortable that I can build my best portfolio website that doesn't ever need another rework. Since that's going to take a couple months.

## Features
I am quite a perfectionist when it comes to UI / UX design and it seemed like jQuery could solve the features that I wanted to implement more efficiently, so I started 
to learn and use jQuery. Now obviously, I am still learning, but it already helped me a ton, especially in getting myself some researching practice. Current features 
include:

- fadeIn of the <body> on every load of the page.
- fadeOut of the <body> every time an <a> tag is being clicked on.
- fadeIn of the <body> in case the "back" arrow of the client's browser is used.
  This would usually end up in the earlier page still being faded out, due to the fact that this state is being saved.
- Designated function to make sure the above feature works on iOS, which it natively does not.
- changing <button> text on click event.
- flowing linear gradient on button on hover event.

 #### This is still a work in progress.
This page will be updated over time.
